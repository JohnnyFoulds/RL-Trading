# This is sample trading env from 01B) https://github.com/notadamking/Stock-Trading-Visualization
# But performance is really bad. Makes 38% losses. But code uses stable_baselines and is really clean
from env.StockTradingEnv import StockTradingEnv 

# this is from xiong's code but is reallly messy. 
# this is now renamed zxStock_env into StockEnv and try to refactor code to uses table_baselines and 01B approach of coding
from env.StockEnv import StockEnv


xiong's data set is just using a numpy series
	data_3['adjcp'] = data_3['prccd'] / data_3['ajexdi']
	train_data = data_3[(data_3.datadate > 20090000) & (data_3.datadate < 20160000)]
